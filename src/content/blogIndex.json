    "content": "Not every robot needs to solve world hunger. Some just need to make you laugh. Or scream. Or explode in a puddle of chaotic joy.\nHere’s a short list of robots that made me smile while building them:\n- **WeirdBot** – Programmed with intentionally broken logic, it zig-zagged, spun in circles, and occasionally just gave up. Pure chaos. Pure fun.  \n- **BottleRocketRover** – Powered by soda bottles, water, and compressed air. It launched forward like a caffeinated toddler with no brakes.  \n- **ScreamBot** – The closer you got, the louder it screamed. Motion sensors + a buzzer + a bad attitude = endless entertainment.\nAll of them were born out of junk parts, last-minute ideas, hot glue, and too much coffee.\nThey didn’t follow the rules. And that’s why I loved them.\n---\n**What they taught me:**\n- Don't optimize too early.  \n- Embrace the mess.  \n- If it sparks joy (or actual sparks), it’s working.\n> **Rule #1: Let the robot misbehave at least once.**  \n> Otherwise, it’s just a machine."

    "content": "Most people build for function. I build for fun — and function follows.\nEver since I hacked together my first robot from e-waste, I realized something: weirdness is power. The more absurd a project looks, the more curious people get. And curiosity is where the magic starts.\n**Weird inspires. Weird teaches. Weird makes you ask \"how?\"**\nWhether it's a robot that screams when bumped, or a charger that breathes like it's alive, I build things to surprise — and in doing so, to teach.\n> \"If it looks too normal, it's probably already been done.\"\nThis blog is my corner of the internet where I get to share the chaos behind the creation. Let’s make more weird things.\nDream. Make. Share."
