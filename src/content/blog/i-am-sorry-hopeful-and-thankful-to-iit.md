## I Apologize For

- **Not being a rote learner.**  
- **Maybe not achieving enough marks to have the pleasure of studying at your esteemed institutes.**  
- **Maybe not sacrificing enough.**  
- **Being a good engineer but possibly not good enough at a simple test.**

---

## I Sincerely Hope That

- **The students who reach your institutes genuinely love engineering, just as I do.**  
- **They appreciate your labs and facilities as I had hoped.**  
- **They learn from the best, just like I aspired to.**  
- **Maybe someday, I will actually be able to enjoy studying at your institutes.**

## I Am Thankful For

- **Teaching me the value of hard work.**  
- **Teaching me to multitask and effectively manage my time.**  
- **Allowing me to fail and teaching me to accept it gracefully.**  
- **The incredibly challenging Physics and Mathematics questions I have encountered in the past two years. They truly stimulated my mind and fostered growth.**

These thoughts weigh heavily on my mind, and I genuinely hope that one day the IITs will devise a more inclusive method for admissions — one that is not confined to narrow criteria but encompasses a broader evaluation of students' character and genuine interest in the field, not just a single examination.

Over the past six years, I have dedicated myself to engineering and innovation, working with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Nvidia Jetson, and learning Linux and coding essentials. But I’ve realized these pursuits may not carry much weight in the admission process to institutions like the IITs.

It seems to matter little how many competitions I’ve won or how many innovations I’ve created — even if they were hosted by the IITs or BITS themselves. These achievements, which have shaped who I am, are often considered irrelevant.

Still, I have no regrets.

I poured my heart into everything I did, worked tirelessly, and learned immensely. If given the chance, I would do it all again — with the same passion and drive.

The competitions, the robots, the nights debugging code — they’ve moulded me. Maybe if IITs considered the **essence** of a candidate, not just their JEE Advanced score, there would be room for more students like me.

As I await results, uncertain of what comes next, I write this not to seek validation — but for closure. And perhaps, for others like me who believe engineering is more than an exam score.

In the future, I hope reservations will be granted to those who possess **extraordinary abilities and contributions** in their respective fields, beyond caste or lineage.

I know this may never get a reply. But that’s okay.

This letter is for me, and maybe for someone out there who needed to hear it.

**This was JEE Aspirant 2023 – Adit Luthra**  
*Grade 12, aiming for Electronics and Communication Engineering.*

As I close this chapter, I retire this identity in search of something more. Something deeper. Something that matters.

### In conclusion, I want to express:  
**I am sorry, hopeful, and grateful.**
