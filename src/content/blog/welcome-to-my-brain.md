**For those who don't know me, I am Adit Luthra. I call myself the Galactic God.**

Let me tell you a little about myself:

- I love to **learn**.  
- I would like to **save the world someday**.  
- I want to **create a world that I am excited to live in**.  
- I want to **build a new city or island** someday — a model city.  
- I am a **cypherpunk**.  
- I love **meeting intelligent people**.  
- I am **considered crazy by most**.  
- I love to **do what others call impossible**.  
- I believe in a **gender- and religion-neutral world**.

Now that you know the highlights of Adit Luthra, let's get started.

I’ll be using this blog like a notebook — a mirror to my mind — and invite you to join me on this journey as I pursue whatever I set out to do in this life.

You’ll watch my short-term goals evolve, but my long-term ones?  
They’ll stay rooted in something deeper.

**I HOPE!!**
