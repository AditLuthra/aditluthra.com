# Why I Build Weird Things

Most people build for function. I build for fun — and function follows.

Ever since I hacked together my first robot from e-waste, I realized something: weirdness is power. The more absurd a project looks, the more curious people get. And curiosity is where the magic starts.

**Weird inspires. Weird teaches. Weird makes you ask "how?"**

Whether it's a robot that screams when bumped, or a charger that breathes like it's alive, I build things to surprise — and in doing so, to teach.

> "If it looks too normal, it's probably already been done."

This blog is my corner of the internet where I get to share the chaos behind the creation. Let’s make more weird things.

Dream. Make. Share.
