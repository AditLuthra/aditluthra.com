# Still Weird. Still Building.

**By Adit Luthra**

Sorry for disappearing on you guys.  
No dramatic reason — just me being... me.  
A mix of laziness, forgetfulness, some late-night deep dives, and honestly just existing.  
But I’m still here. And I’ll try to update you more often from now on.

## So, what’s new?

Well, the **website’s got a new face**, and maybe I do too.

In the past two years:

- I’ve built a lot of things. Some weird. Some pointless. Some that might just change everything.  
- Met people I wish I hadn’t. Met people I hope stick around forever.  
- Got into rabbit holes of philosophy, product design, firmware, why humans suck, and why they don’t.  
- Laughed a lot. Burned out. Made a comeback (I think).  
- Stayed up till 4 AM watching open-source schematics and wondering why I can’t sleep.

Oh, and I’m somehow entering my **third year of college**.  
Feels strange. Feels fast. Feels fake. But it’s happening.  
There was a time I wrote here about not getting into my dream college.  
That wasn’t this blog’s identity — just a snapshot. One post.  
The rest? A messy timeline of things I cared about when I remembered to write.

## What now?

Well, I’ve been **building something**.  
Something real. Something big.  
Can’t say much yet. But it’s hidden here. All around this site.  
In the style. In the structure. In the things I haven’t said outright.

Let’s just say:  
I’m tired of waiting for the world to catch up.  
So I’m building my own.

This isn’t a comeback post.  
No newsletter. No “hey guys!”  
Just a little ping across the void to say:

I’m alive. I’ve grown. And I’m still building.

**Thanks for still being here.**  
If you’re reading this, it means you care — and that matters more than numbers ever will.

Catch you when the next wave hits.

### 📓 Terminal Log  
`[02:53 AM]` Writing this with **250 Chrome tabs open**, 4 forgotten Trello boards, a half-eaten protein bar, and an idea that won’t leave me alone.  
(Also, my soldering iron is still on. Should probably do something about that.)
