Robots I Loved

Not every robot needs to solve world hunger. Some just need to make you laugh. Or scream. Or explode in a puddle of chaotic joy.

Here’s a short list of robots that made me smile while building them:

- **WeirdBot** – Programmed with intentionally broken logic, it zig-zagged, spun in circles, and occasionally just gave up. Pure chaos. Pure fun.  
- **BottleRocketRover** – Powered by soda bottles, water, and compressed air. It launched forward like a caffeinated toddler with no brakes.  
- **ScreamBot** – The closer you got, the louder it screamed. Motion sensors + a buzzer + a bad attitude = endless entertainment.

All of them were born out of junk parts, last-minute ideas, hot glue, and too much coffee.

They didn’t follow the rules. And that’s why I loved them.

**What they taught me:**

- Don't optimize too early.  
- Embrace the mess.  
- If it sparks joy (or actual sparks), it’s working.

> **Rule #1: Let the robot misbehave at least once.**  
> Otherwise, it’s just a machine.
