# Robots I Loved

Here’s a short list of robots that made me smile while building them:

- **WeirdBot** – a robot with intentionally random logic patterns and chaotic movement.
- **BottleRocketRover** – a water-propelled rover that runs on compressed soda bottles.
- **ScreamBot** – yells louder the closer you get (uses a distance sensor + buzzer).

All of them were built using scrap, sensors, hot glue, and too much coffee.

They taught me more than any book ever could.

**Rule #1: Let the robot misbehave at least once.**
